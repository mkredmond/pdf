<div id="yui-main"> <div class="yui-b">   <h1>About St. John Fisher College</h1> <div class="clear"></div> <h2>Mission Statement</h2> <p></p> <h3>Vision Statement</h3> <p>By the end of the decade, we will be a widely recognized college in the Northeast Region that enriches student character and deepens intellectual inquiry to prepare men and women for success in a complex and diverse global community.</p> <p><em>Adopted by the Board of Trustees, June 2012</em></p> <h3>Concise Mission Statement</h3> <p>St. John Fisher College is a collaborative community dedicated to teaching, learning, and scholarship in a student-centered educational environment. The College is guided by its liberal arts tradition and its Catholic heritage, as expressed in the motto of its founders, the Basilian Fathers: "teach me goodness, discipline, and knowledge." Fisher engages individuals in lives of intellectual inquiry, professional integrity, and civic responsibility, where diversity and service to others are valued and practiced.</p> <p align="right"><i>Adopted by the Board of Trustees, June 2012</i></p> <div> <h2><strong>About Us</strong></h2> <p>St. John Fisher College is an independent liberal arts institution in the Catholic tradition of American higher education. Guided since its inception by the educational philosophy of the Congregation of St. Basil, the College emphasizes liberal learning for students in traditional academic disciplines as well as those in more directly career-oriented fields. In keeping with the openness that is characteristic of its Basilian heritage, Fisher welcomes qualified students, faculty, and staff regardless of religious or cultural background.</p> <p>Our commitment to individuals from varied backgrounds and with differing educational needs reflects both our emphasis on lifelong learning and our direct involvement in the community of which we are a part.</p> <p>As an institution of higher learning, we engage our students in the quest for knowledge and truth, believing that such engagement will equip them to make sound judgments as individuals, family members, and citizens. We provide individual guidance to students as they develop values that will guide them in meaningful and productive lives. Our dual emphasis on intellectual and personal growth derives from our belief that learning is valuable for its own sake, for the sake of those who learn, and for the sake of society as a whole.</p> <p>We recognize continuing research as an indispensable part of effective teaching and seek to maintain a faculty whose creative participation in the development of the arts and sciences will inspire students to love and respect learning. Faculty members strive for superior academic quality by placing a high priority on teaching and a dedication to the growth and development of each individual graduate student.</p> <p>St. John Fisher College is located in Pittsford, New York, only a few minutes by car or bus from the center of the city of Rochester. The city is noted for its excellent philharmonic orchestra, an art gallery with a diverse and valuable collection, a science museum, the Strasenburgh Planetarium, as well as the historic George Eastman House with its museum of photography. Rochester also has a high concentration of some of the finest hospitals and healthcare facilities in the nation, giving students an excellent opportunity to study and practice in clinical settings.</p> <p>Our urban proximity provides both support to the regional professional communities and a significant source of hands-on experience for graduate students. Over the years, students have had enriching opportunities to work on projects, consult, complete internships, and otherwise involve themselves in the business, healthcare, human service, educational, and government communities at our doorstep. Additionally, representatives of these professions visit the Fisher campus regularly to supplement classroom theory via guest lectures, seminars, workshops, and adjunct teaching.</p> </div> </div> </div>

<div id="yui-main"> <div class="yui-b">   <h1>General Policies</h1> <div class="clear"></div> <h2>Attendance</h2> <p>It is expected that students will attend all classes and required class activities. The attendance policy for each course is provided by the instructor in the course syllabus.</p> <h2>Change of Course (Drop/Add)</h2> <p>No change of course is permitted after the last date for such change as listed in the semester <a title="Academic Calendar" href="/graduate/2015-2016/academic-information/calendar/">academic calendar</a>.</p> <h2>Withdrawal From College</h2> <p>A student who withdraws from all courses in a semester is considered to have withdrawn from the College and must officially inform the Registrar&rsquo;s Office and leave all affairs in satisfactory condition. Failure to withdraw officially will result in the grades of &ldquo;F,&rdquo; &ldquo;U,&rdquo; or &ldquo;FA&rdquo; being assigned. Tuition and other appropriate charges will be fully assessed. This applies to students who withdraw from all courses even if they intend to return the next semester.</p> <h2>Withdrawal for Students Called to Active Military Duty</h2> <p>Students called to active duty must provide the College with a copy of their military orders and follow these steps to withdraw from the College:</p> <ul> <li>Schedule an appointment with the school dean or department chair to discuss academic options. Depending on the point in the semester, the student may choose to withdraw without academic record or to take grades of &ldquo;W&rdquo; in all courses or to pursue grades of &ldquo;I&rdquo; in all courses.</li> <li>Schedule an appointment with Student Accounts to discuss the financial ramifications of the different academic options to determine which option will be the best choice financially. The student may be referred to the Financial Aid Office for additional discussion.</li> <li>Submit the completed <a href="http://www.sjfc.edu/campus-services/registrar/students/withdraw.dot">Withdrawal From College form</a>.</li> </ul> <p>If the student chooses to withdraw, it must be a full withdrawal; the student may not choose to remain in some courses and withdraw from others. Residence hall room and board will be prorated in accordance with College policies. Failure to provide the military orders will result in normal withdrawal processing.</p> <h2>Leave of Absence</h2> <p>A student who will be away from the college for more than two semesters should request a leave of absence.</p> <p>To request a leave of absence, the student must submit the Leave of Absence form, available in the Registrar&rsquo;s Office, to the school dean. The request must specify the reason for requesting the leave, a time limit (not longer than two years), and an outline of how the student plans to complete the program requirements upon return. The dean, in consultation with the program director, will review the student&rsquo;s request. The student will be notified in writing of the decision.</p> <p>An approved leave of absence does not automatically extend the student&rsquo;s time to degree completion beyond the standard 6 years from initial matriculation, and may also result in the need to repeat some previously completed coursework.</p> <p>A student on leave who does not return at the end of a leave will be withdrawn from the College as of the date the leave began.</p> <p>If enrollment has been discontinued for more than two semesters, but less than two years, a student must contact the Office of Graduate Admissions to complete a modified readmission process.</p> <p>If enrollment has been discontinued for more than two years a student must repeat the full admissions process.</p> <p></p> </div> </div>
<div id="yui-main"> <div class="yui-b">   <h1>Transfer Credits</h1> <div class="clear"></div> <p>A maximum of nine credits of appropriate graduate work completed at other institutions in accredited graduate programs may be considered for transfer into a master&rsquo;s degree program. The credits must have been completed with a grade of &ldquo;B&rdquo; or higher and be appropriate to the program of study at Fisher.</p> <p>For courses taken prior to admission, students should submit the Transfer Credit Request form including the course description to the Office of Graduate Admissions with an official transcript.</p> <p>For courses taken after admission, matriculated students must submit the Transfer Credit Request form to the program director with the course description prior to registering for off-campus study.</p> <p>Determination of appropriateness for transfer credit will be made at the sole discretion of the program director. Grades earned in courses transferred from other institutions do not affect the Fisher grade point average.</p> <p>For coursework taken as quarter-hours, students receive credit for two-thirds of the total hours earned.</p> </div> </div>
<div id="yui-main"> <div class="yui-b">   <h1>Independent Study</h1> <div class="clear"></div> <p>Independent study plays a valuable educational role in the graduate curriculum. The quality and quantity of academic endeavor expected of a student in an independent study course project must be equivalent to expectations in the regular class setting.</p> <p>For each credit hour of independent study, a minimum of 45 clock hours, in combination with meetings between the instructor and student as well as any supplementary assignments, readings, and/or research conducted by the student, is required. An independent study may not duplicate the content of a regularly offered course.</p> <p>To enroll in an independent study course:</p> <ul> <li>The student must prepare a written proposal and submit it to the appropriate faculty member and/or program director. The proposal must include the intent of the independent study course project, including goals, content, and mode of assessment.</li> <li>The student must complete the Independent Study/Individualized Instruction Authorization form, provide all documentation, and obtain all required signatures.</li> <li>If the independent study course project is approved by the graduate program director and the dean, the registrar will process the form and return a copy to the student.</li> <li>Work on the independent study course project should not begin until the approvals are confirmed, the paperwork is processed, and the course appears on the instructor&rsquo;s class listing in <a href="http://fishrnet.sjfc.edu" title="Fish &lsquo;R&rsquo; Net">Fish &lsquo;R&rsquo; Net</a>.</li> </ul> <p>After the paperwork is processed, the student will carry out the independent study course project, maintaining regular contact with the instructor as the work proceeds.</p> <p><b>Note:</b> <i>Requests for independent study courses will be processed in keeping with the relevant registration deadlines.

<div id="yui-main"> <div class="yui-b">   <h1>Tutorial Courses</h1> <div class="clear"></div> <p>Courses taught as tutorial courses are individualized instruction in the content of a course listed in the college catalog. These courses, though taught independently, carry the subject, number, title, and credits of the actual course.</p> <p>Tutorial courses are offered only under unusual circumstances when a student is unable to register for the course during its regular offering cycle. The Dean&rsquo;s approval of a tutorial course is required and dependent on suitable justification of its necessity and the availability of an instructor to undertake the course.</p> <p>To enroll in a tutorial course:</p> <ul> <li>The student meets with the instructor who offers the requested course to discuss the possibility of a tutorial and the justification.</li> <li>After securing the approval of the instructor, the student completes the individualized instruction portion of the Independent Study/Individualized Instruction Authorization form, provides all documentation, and obtains all required signatures.</li> <li>The student then meets with the graduate program director to discuss the requested tutorial course and the justification.</li> <li>If the request is approved by the graduate program director and the dean, a request to create the course in Banner for the specified semester will be sent to the Registrar&rsquo;s Office.

<div id="yui-main"> <div class="yui-b">   <h1>Institutional Review Board</h1> <div class="clear"></div> <p>Students who are learning about and using the research process in courses or projects should understand and appropriately use Institutional Review Board (IRB) policies and procedures. The function of the IRB is to safeguard the rights and welfare of individual research participants. The three levels of review&mdash;exempt, expedited, and full&mdash;are determined based on the amount of risk to human subjects involved in the activity.</p> <p>According to the IRB guidelines, &ldquo;activities within the scope of the IRB&rsquo;s activities include research, development and related activities which would normally be construed as biological, behavioral, or psychological investigations involving human subjects.&rdquo; The Fisher IRB committee has developed guidelines for faculty and students as they determine the need and extent of IRB review. Research is defined as an activity that involves data collection from human subjects, along with the analysis and reporting of that analysis.</p> <p>The three levels of review are:</p> <ul> <li><i>Exempt Review</i> (least risk): Relates to those situations in which data collection is an in-class activity, including those courses in which students are learning about the research process. This activity could be given exempt status, which involves a simple form and notification to the committee that this activity is taking place.</li> <li><i>Expedited Review</i> (low risk): If the data collection activity is related to a course assignment, including master&rsquo;s projects, and involves the participation of off-campus personnel, it is often deemed an expedited review as it involves a review of the instruments used, a consent form, and the completion of another form which records that this activity is being conducted under the auspices of St. John Fisher College. Expedited review does not require a full review by the entire committee and can be done quickly. Students can begin the implementation of data collection within a few weeks after submission of the research proposal.</li> <li><i>Full Review</i> (risk to subjects/participants is inherent in the design): This level of research and data collection activity requires a presentation to the IRB by the student and a full committee review for the purpose of protecting human subjects participating in the activity.</li> </ul> <p>Students work collaboratively with faculty to determine the need for IRB review. Copies of the IRB packets are available in the Office of Academic Affairs or the IRB website at <a title="Institutional Review Board" href="http://www.sjfc.edu/academics/irb">http://www.sjfc.edu/academics/irb</a>.</p> </div> </div>
<div id="yui-main"> <div class="yui-b">   <h1>Education Records and FERPA</h1> <div class="clear"></div> <h2>Annual Notification of Rights Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act</h2> <p>St. John Fisher College complies fully with the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Under FERPA, students have, with certain limited exceptions, certain rights with respect to their education records. These rights include:</p> <h3>The right to inspect and review the student&rsquo;s education records within 45 days of the day the College receives a request for access.</h3> <p>Students should submit to the appropriate official written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The College official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the College official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.</p> <p>Only records covered by FERPA will be made available. Students may have copies made of their records, except for an academic record for which a financial &ldquo;hold&rdquo; exists or a transcript of an original or source document. Copies will be made at the student&rsquo;s expense at prevailing rates.</p> <h4>Type, Location, and Custodian of Education Records Maintained by the College</h4> <table style="width: 100%;" class="rounded"> <tbody> <tr> <td class="odd tl">Type</td> <td class="odd">Location</td> <td class="odd tr">Custodian</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Admission Records</td> <td>Office of Admissions</td> <td>Director of Admissions</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Academic Records</td> <td>Registrar&rsquo;s Office</td> <td>Director of Academic Information and Registrar</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Health Records</td> <td>Health &amp; Wellness Center</td> <td>Director of Health &amp; Wellness Center</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Financial Aid Records</td> <td>Financial Aid Office</td> <td>Director of Financial Aid</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Financial Records</td> <td>Student Accounts</td> <td>Director of Student Accounts</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Graduate Placement Records</td> <td>Career Center</td> <td>Director of Career Center</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Disability Records</td> <td>Office of Academic Affairs</td> <td>Coordinator of Disability Services</td> </tr> <tr class="last"> <td class="bl">Student Conduct Records</td> <td>Office of the Vice-President for Student Affairs &amp; Diversity Initiatives</td> <td class="br">Vice-President for Student Affairs &amp; Diversity Initiatives</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3>The right to request the amendment of the student&rsquo;s education records that the student believes are inaccurate or misleading.</h3> <p>Students may ask the College to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading. They should write the College official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading.</p> <p>If the College decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the College will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment.</p> <p>Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing.</p> <h3>The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student&rsquo;s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent.</h3> <p>One exception is disclosure to parents of dependent students. Another exception is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests, on a &ldquo;need-to-know&rdquo; basis, as determined by the administrator responsible for the file. A &ldquo;school official&rdquo; includes: anyone employed by the College in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); any person or company acting on behalf of the College (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); any member of the Board of Trustees or other governance/advisory body; and any student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility; to perform a task that is specified in his or her position description or contract; to perform a task related to a student&rsquo;s education or to student discipline; to provide a service or benefit related to the student or student&rsquo;s family (e.g., job placement, health insurance); or to maintain safety and security on campus. Upon request, the College may disclose education records without the consent of the student to officials of another school in which the student seeks or intends to enroll.</p> <p>Other exceptions are described in the FERPA statute and regulations at 34 CFR Part 99.</p> <h3>The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the College to comply with the requirements of FERPA.</h3> <p>The name and address of the office that administers FERPA is:</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Family Policy Compliance Office <br />U.S. Department of Education<br />400 Maryland Avenue, S.W.<br />Washington, D.C. 20202-4605</p> <h2>Directory Information</h2> <p>The College has designated the following information as directory information:</p> <ul> <li>Student&rsquo;s name</li> <li>College email address</li> <li>Address</li> <li>Telephone number</li> <li>Date and place of birth</li> <li>Hometown</li> <li>High school</li> <li>Field(s) of study</li> <li>Advisor name(s)</li> <li>Full-time/part-time status</li> <li>Class year</li> <li>Dates of attendance</li> <li>Date of graduation</li> <li>Degrees and awards received</li> <li>Most recent previous educational institution attended</li> <li>Participation in officially recognized activities and sports</li> <li>Weight and height of members of athletic teams</li> </ul> <p>The College may publicize or respond to requests for such information at its discretion. However, the use of the records for commercial or political purposes is prohibited unless approved by the appropriate dean.</p> <p>Currently enrolled students may request that directory information be withheld from disclosure by filing the appropriate form with the Registrar within two weeks after the first day of classes for the fall semester. Requests made after this date should still be forwarded since they will prevent directory information from being released in the future. The College assumes that failure on the part of the student to specifically request the withholding of any directory information indicates approval of disclosure.</p> <p>Request for nondisclosure will be honored by the institution and remain in effect until withdrawn by the student in writing. Students are advised to exercise caution in requesting nondisclosure of directory information since the inability to verify attendance and/or graduation may adversely affect future employment.</p> <p><b>Note:</b> <i>Notification to students of their rights under FERPA is sent via College email each year at the start of the fall semester.</i></p> <h2>Release of Personal Information to Military Recruiters</h2> <p>At the request of military branches, the regulations under the Solomon Amendment, 32 CFR Part 215, require the College to release select information on currently enrolled students to military recruiters for the sole purpose of military recruiting. Before releasing the requested information, the College will ask if the intent is to use the requested information only for military recruiting purposes.</p> <p>The military is entitled to receive information about students who are &ldquo;currently enrolled,&rdquo; which is defined as registered for at least one credit hour of academic credit during the most recent, current, or next term.</p> <p>Under the Solomon Amendment, the military is entitled to receive the following student information:</p> <ul> <li>Name</li> <li>Age or year of birth</li> <li>Address</li> <li>Major</li> <li>Telephone number</li> <li>Level of education (i.e., freshman, sophomore, or degree awarded to a recent graduate)</li> </ul> <p>If a student has requested that his or her directory information not be disclosed to third parties, as is permitted under FERPA, that student&rsquo;s information will not be released to the military under the Solomon Amendment. In such instances, the school will remove the student&rsquo;s information sent to the military and note &ldquo;We have not provided information for X number of students because they have requested that their directory information not be disclosed as permitted by FERPA.&rdquo;</p> </div> </div>

If deemed appropriate, the student must complete the appropriate Petition to Take Graduate Classes form and obtain the required approvals. If approved, the undergraduate student may take up to two graduate courses (maximum six credits).</p> <p>To be eligible to enroll in a graduate course, undergraduate students must have an undergraduate cumulative GPA of 3.00 or higher and have completed at least 90 undergraduate credits.</p> <p>These courses carry graduate credit and are taken in addition to those required to earn the baccalaureate degree at St. John Fisher College. Participation does not guarantee acceptance into the graduate program after completion of the baccalaureate degree. Registration will be on a space-available basis and is determined the week before classes begin.</p> <p>For students already attending full-time as undergraduates (12 credits or more) and paying the prevailing full-time tuition, the tuition charge for the graduate courses will be waived. Students attending part-time (11 credits or less) will pay the prevailing per-credit graduate tuition for the graduate course.</p> <p>Exception: Matriculated undergraduate nursing students may petition to take an approved GNUR graduate course for undergraduate credit. The completed course will appear on the undergraduate transcript until the graduate program is begun, at which time the course(s) will also appear on the graduate transcript.

To earn a graduate degree from St. John Fisher College, the student must:</p> <ul> <li>Earn a minimum of 30 credits and complete all program requirements.</li> <li>Earn a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 for all courses taken in residence.</li> <li>File a Petition for Graduation.</li> <li>Complete the program within the appropriate time limit.</li> </ul> <p><i>*See the <a href="http://catalog.sjfc.edu/graduate/2015-2016/academic-programs/school.dot?id=243db284-703a-4bdb-a098-08475de92512">Wegmans School of Pharmacy</a></i><i>&nbsp;for requirements. </i></p> <h2>Degree Completion Time Limit</h2> <p>For programs requiring fewer than 60 credits, a student must finish the degree within six years of completion of the first Fisher graduate course. For programs requiring 60 or more credits, students must finish the degree within eight years of completion of the first Fisher graduate course. Only the program director and provost or his designee can grant exceptions. Students granted extensions may be required to repeat certain previously taken courses. The time limit is inclusive of any leaves of absence taken by a student. Individual programs may have more stringent requirements for completion; check the individual programs for further information. The first graduate course taken at St. John Fisher College starts this time clock.</p> <h2>Graduation</h2> <p>Students who qualify for graduation must notify the Registrar&rsquo;s Office by filing the online Graduation application. Submission of this form initiates an administrative process in which the student&rsquo;s record is reviewed with regard to program requirements for graduation and potential difficulties. Notification of the availability of the online application will be sent to students using their Fisher email accounts. Failure to apply on time may result in a delay in graduation. St. John Fisher College confers degrees three times per year, in May, August, and December.</p> <p>The College-wide commencement takes place once a year, in May. To participate in the May commencement ceremony, graduate-level degree candidates must have completed their degree requirements prior to the actual day of commencement or be within nine credits of completion and have the approval of their program director. August and December graduates will be invited to attend the commencement ceremony the following May. Outstanding &ldquo;I&rdquo; grades and credit-by-examination results, as well as waivers and substitutions and the processing of transfer credit, should be completed well in advance of graduation. If all documents are not received in the Registrar&rsquo;s Office by the end of the final examination period, your graduation will be delayed to the following semester. Any &ldquo;I&rdquo; grade earned in the term in which you plan to graduate will result in your graduation being delayed until the following term.</p> </div> </div>

The instructor, after consultation with the student, submits an Incomplete (I) grade.</p> <p>The missing coursework must be completed by the published deadline which is six weeks from the last day of final examinations for the term.</p> <p>If the missing work is not submitted by the deadline, the Incomplete grade will be converted to a Failing (F) or Unsatisfactory (U) grade as appropriate.</p> <p>The instructor and student will receive weekly email reminders from the Registrar&rsquo;s office until the incomplete grade is resolved.</p> <p>An appeal for an extension of the six week deadline must be filed in writing with the Program Director at least one week before the Incomplete (I) grade is scheduled to convert to an F or U. The appeal must contain a full explanation of why an extension is being requested and have the written support of the instructor.

If the &ldquo;IP&rdquo; is not replaced with a passing final grade by the deadline, the IP will convert to an F or U as appropriate. In this case, to earn credit for the course, the student must register for the course again and pay the prevailing per credit tuition charge.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Withdrawal From Course</h2> <p>Students may withdraw from courses without academic record, with a grade of &ldquo;W&rdquo; or with the penalty grade of &ldquo;F&rdquo; as noted in the <a title="Semester Calendar" href="/graduate/2015-2016/academic-information/calendar/">semester academic calendar</a>.

When a course is retaken, all grades appear on the transcript; however, the grade received the last time the course is taken will be the grade computed in the GPA. If a student repeats a course in which a passing grade below &ldquo;B&rdquo; has been earned, additional credits are not earned.</p> <h2>Auditing</h2> <p>With permission of the instructor and program director, individuals holding bachelor&rsquo;s degrees may audit select courses. Audit students do not earn credit. The faculty member determines the conditions of the audit with regard to assignments and examinations in discussion with the auditor. Auditors must have the written approval of the course instructor and cannot retroactively upgrade to credit-seeking status. Additionally, a credit student cannot switch to audit status.

<div id="yui-main"> <div class="yui-b">   <h1>Academic Support</h1> <div class="clear"></div> <h2>Academic Advising</h2> <p>The essence of a quality graduate experience is academic advising. Each program has its own system for delivering information and monitoring the progress of its students. It is essential that each graduate student contact the assigned advisor upon admission. Early contact with the advisor is most important to avoid scheduling conflicts and problems with course sequencing and to ensure understanding of the steps required to complete the program. <b>Ultimately, the final responsibility for knowing and meeting all graduation requirements rests with the individual student.</b></p> <p>Program directors are available for informational interviews prior to applying and for assistance with course registration. Students are encouraged to contact the Office of Academic Affairs for help with general problem-solving and other needs.</p> <h2>Long-Range Plan</h2> <p>This tool tracks progress from initial registration to graduation for the student and advisor. Long-range plans should be revised as needed. Each graduate student should have a long-range plan on file by the end of the first semester. Students should contact their academic advisors to complete this plan.</p> <h2>Scheduling</h2> <p>As a convenience for working students, the majority of graduate courses meet evenings or weekends. Semesters begin in early September, mid-January, and mid-May. Registration/orientation sessions are held each semester for newly admitted students.</p> <h2>Study Hours</h2> <p>In general, students are expected to spend two hours per week in outside reading, assignments, research, library work, etc., for every one hour they spend in class. For example, a student who is enrolled in 15 credits during a semester will spend 15 hours per week in class and another 30 hours each week engaged in academic pursuits outside the classroom, for a total expected time commitment of 45 hours per week (also subject to change).</p> </div> </div>
<div id="yui-main"> <div class="yui-b">   <h1>Registration</h1> <div class="clear"></div> <p>A student must be registered to earn credit for a course in the semester in which the course is taken. New students course-register prior to the first day of classes; returning students course-register during the current semester for the following semester.</p> <p>Registration takes place in November for the spring semester and April for the summer and fall semesters when students course-register using <a href="http://fishrnet.sjfc.edu" title="Fish &lsquo;R&rsquo; Net">Fish &lsquo;R&rsquo; Net</a> (the College&rsquo;s web-based student information system). This process generates a tuition bill for which payment is due approximately one month before the semester begins. Students who have not made arrangements to pay their tuition may be dropped from their courses and will be subject to both a Late Payment fee of up to $200 and a Reinstatement fee of $300.</p> <p>Ultimately, the student is responsible for all registration, add, drop, and withdrawal activities on his or her record at the College. Registration should be done at the earliest opportunity to minimize the chance of being closed out of a course and to ensure that the College has accurate enrollment numbers to use in course-related decisions. Students may attend only classes in which they are registered. Students must verify their registration using <a href="http://fishrnet.sjfc.edu">Fish &lsquo;R&rsquo; Net</a> to be sure they are attending the correct classes and sections.

If web activity is allowed, the student must make all changes using <a href="http://fishrnet.sjfc.edu" title="Fish &lsquo;R&rsquo; Net">Fish &lsquo;R&rsquo; Net</a>; if web activity has ended, the student must make all changes in the Registrar&rsquo;s Office using a Drop/Add form.</p> <p>It is the student&rsquo;s responsibility to know and register for the courses appropriate for his or her program requirements. The advisor provides assistance but is not responsible for the student&rsquo;s course selection or errors in choosing courses. Students should be aware of and meet all of the dates and deadlines for registration, drop/add, and withdrawal from courses. Registration, adding, dropping, or withdrawing from a course after a published deadline must be approved by the registrar. If approved, these requests will be subject to the $50 Late Course Change fee.</p> <p>Schedules and grade reports are available in <a href="http://fishrnet.sjfc.edu" title="Fish &lsquo;R&rsquo; Net">Fish &lsquo;R&rsquo; Net</a>. Some documents are still mailed; therefore, students should keep their mailing addresses updated by notifying the Registrar&rsquo;s Office of changes.</p> <p>The College reserves the right at any time to make changes deemed advisable in policies and procedures, as well as in tuition and fees, and to cancel any course if enrollment does not justify continuance.</p> </div> </div>

It is the policy of the College to mail this record as a complete document; therefore, requests for only a portion of the record will not be honored.</p> <p>Though transcripts from other institutions may be included in the student&rsquo;s permanent academic folder, the College does not produce copies of official transcripts of academic work taken at other institutions for external distribution.</p> </div> </div>

<div id="yui-main"> <div class="yui-b">   <h1>Policy for Admissions Review Involving Prior Convictions, Pending Criminal Charges, and Prior Suspensions/Dismissals</h1> <div class="clear"></div> <p>St. John Fisher College recognizes its role in maintaining a safe community for its students and College employees. As part of this effort, applicants for admission to the College (undergraduate or graduate) are required to disclose any prior criminal convictions or pending criminal charges (felony or misdemeanor, with the exception of any proceedings involving &ldquo;youthful offender adjudication&rdquo; as defined in NYS Criminal procedure Law Section 720.35 or any conviction sealed pursuant to NYS Criminal procedure Law Sections 160.55 or 160.58) as well as any past disciplinary suspensions or dismissals from higher educational institutions. Additional review may be required for those applicants seeking admission to programs in the Wegmans School of Nursing, the Wegmans School of Pharmacy, or the Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. School of Education.</p> <p>Prior criminal or disciplinary actions are not an automatic bar to admission. The College recognizes that automatically depriving past offenders of an education may not be in the best interest of the individual, the educational mission of the College, or society at large. However, this recognition must be balanced against the College&rsquo;s need to carefully evaluate and determine the possibility that admission or presence of the student on campus poses an undue risk to the safety, security or welfare of the College or the College community, or is otherwise, on balance, not in the College Community&rsquo;s best interest. While the Committee will exercise its judgment in a thoughtful, rational manner, in the end, the decision of the Committee as to whether or not to recommend admission is in the Committee&rsquo;s absolute and sole discretion.</p> <p><strong>In all cases in which an applicant to the College has a criminal conviction, pending criminal charges, or has been suspended or expelled from an institute of higher education, a</strong><strong>dditional information will be requested and reviewed by the Admissions Special Review committee. </strong></p> <h4><em>Continued Self-Disclosure</em></h4> <p><em></em>After being admitted and prior to matriculation, any pending charges in any state or country or the conviction of a crime (felony or misdemeanor, with the exception of any proceedings involving &ldquo;youthful offender adjudication&rdquo; as defined in NYS Criminal procedure Law Section 720.35 or any conviction sealed pursuant to NYS Criminal procedure Law Sections 160.55 or 160.58) must be reported to the College. This requirement continues throughout the period of enrollment at St. John Fisher College (including between semesters).</p> <h4><em>Penalty for Failure to Self Disclose</em></h4> <p>Failure of the applicant to self-disclose criminal convictions, pending charges or suspensions/dismissals from a higher educational institution on the admissions application or during any period of enrollment (including between semesters) is a falsification of the record. Upon discovery of such failure to report, the following actions will take place:</p> <ul> <li>If the applicant is not yet enrolled, the offer of admission to the College may be rescinded;</li> <li>If enrolled, the student will be subject to the student conduct process which may include an interim student conduct action and other penalties up to and including expulsion.</li> </ul> </div> </div>
<div id="yui-main"> <div class="yui-b">   <h1>Deferral of Admission & Readmission</h1> <div class="clear"></div> <h2>Deferral of Admission &amp; Readmission</h2> <p>Admitted students who wish to delay their entrance may do so for one semester. Students may request a deferral by contacting the Office of Graduate Admissions. Students who do not request a deferral must reapply with the Office of Graduate Admissions when they are ready to begin their studies.</p> <h2>Readmission</h2> <p>Readmission is required for any graduate student who did not register and complete a course at St. John Fisher College for more than three consecutive semesters or was accepted but did not enroll or update his or her application status. Program directors consider every readmission request on its merits and retain the right to grant or deny admission for a future term.</p> <p>The process for readmission is:</p> <p><b><i>Application:</i></b> Complete and submit the online application or the application form (pdf) found at: <a href="http://www.sjfc.edu/admissions/graduate/apply">www.sjfc.edu/admissions/graduate/apply</a> for the semester you are applying for.</p> <p><b><i>Transcripts: </i></b>Submit official transcripts from the each college and/or university that you attended <b><i>since</i></b> you last attended St. John Fisher College.</p> <p><i>Note: Previous St. John Fisher College (SJFC) students may indicate on their application permission to allow the Graduate Admissions Office to request their official SJFC transcript from the Registrar's Office.</i></p> <p><b><i>Personal Goals Statement</i></b>: Applicants should provide information about yourself, your goals and plans for the future, and reason for graduate study in your chosen field.

<div id="yui-main"> <div class="yui-b">   <h1>International Student Admissions</h1> <div class="clear"></div> <p>The presence of international students is regarded as a great source of cultural enrichment for the College community. The international insight and experience brought to the various graduate classrooms and the opportunity for American students to develop friendships with persons from widely divergent cultures have the potential to enhance the graduate experience. All international students studying at St. John Fisher College with student visas must enroll full-time (9 credits) each semester to comply with the regulations of the U.S. Immigration Service. International students have limited employment opportunities. Therefore, the applicant should not look to on-campus employment, either part-time during the academic year or full-time during official break periods, as a significant means of support while at the College.</p> <h3>Applicants for Graduate International Study must submit the following:</h3> <ul> <li>Completed <a href="http://www.sjfc.edu/dotAsset/87537.pdf" title="Graduate Application">Application Form [pdf]</a> or <a href="https://www.applyweb.com/apply/sjfc/index_stjohngr.html" title="Online Graduate Application">Online Application</a>.

Results of the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) are also accepted. The minimum acceptable IELTS score is 6.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Note:</b> <i>Foreign students who have received their undergraduate degrees from institutions in the United States are exempt from the TOEFL and IELTS.</i></li> <li>Required test scores for specific Graduate Programs (GRE or GMAT)</li> <li>Submission of Personal Goals Statement</li> <li>Two letters of recommendation</li> <li>A current r&eacute;sum&eacute;</li> </ul> <p>Once the items above have been received, an admissions decision can be made.</p> <p>Additional items required for international applicants can be found online through the <a href="http://www.sjfc.edu/admissions/graduate/">Graduate Admissions</a> page.

<div id="yui-main"> <div class="yui-b">   <h1>Student Designations</h1> <div class="clear"></div> <p>Graduate students are admitted with a certain status, depending upon the specific application decision and the student&rsquo;s individual circumstances. The admissions committees try to select candidates who are not only academically strong but who can benefit from the program and who will also contribute significantly to the learning experience of their peers. The admission decision will be based on an evaluation of all criteria rather than upon academic record alone.</p> <h2>Matriculated</h2> <p>Applicants who meet the program admission requirements qualify for matriculated status.</p> <h2>Conditionally Matriculated</h2> <p>Applicants who marginally meet the admission standards but appear to have potential for success in the program based on other evaluation criteria may be matriculated with conditional status. Conditional students can take courses for a maximum of two semesters and should meet with the program director at the end of each semester to discuss their plan and progress. At the conclusion of the second semester, the program director may remove the conditional status for students with a cumulative GPA of 3.00 or higher. All conditional students with a cumulative GPA below 3.00 will be referred to the Graduate Academic Standing Committee for consideration. The committee may place a conditional student on academic probation or dismiss the student from the program.</p> <h2>Provisionally Matriculated</h2> <p>Students are admitted on a provisional basis if supporting documentation is not complete at the time of admission. If all admission components are not in place by the date specified in the letter of acceptance, these students may not be allowed to register for any subsequent courses until their application is complete. Official degree-bearing transcripts must be submitted and received within 30 days of the first day of class of the semester a student matriculates. If you do not submit complete transcripts by this time, you may be withdrawn from Fisher and not allowed to re-enroll until these transcripts have been received by the Office of Graduate Admissions. Full graduate standing is granted when the documents are received in the Office of Graduate Admissions by the date specified in the letter of acceptance.</p> <h2>Non-Matriculated</h2> <p>Students with baccalaureate degrees from accredited undergraduate colleges may register for graduate coursework on a space available basis. These individuals must submit a transcript from the undergraduate institution indicating completion of a bachelor&rsquo;s degree and must complete a Non-matriculated form. Non-matriculated status does not indicate acceptance into a graduate program at Fisher. Students may be non-matriculated for only one semester and enroll in no more than six credits, after which they must submit an application for admission. Financial aid is not available to non-matriculated students.</p> <h2>Continuous Matriculation</h2> <p>Maintenance of matriculation requires the successful completion of at least one graduate-level course at Fisher during the calendar year. Pre-approved transfer credit may be used to meet this requirement for continuous matriculation. Degree requirements existing at the time of admission will remain in force if the student maintains continuous matriculation. A student who discontinues enrollment for more than two semesters must apply for readmission. The student must meet any new requirements for admission, as well as any new requirements for the degree.</p> </div> </div>
<div id="yui-main"> <div class="yui-b">   <h1>Catalog and Degree Requirements</h1> <div class="clear"></div> <p>Students will be certified for graduation based on completion of the degree requirements in force in the catalog under which they were admitted to the College in matriculated status unless otherwise noted. Requests to change to a subsequent catalog must be submitted in writing to the Registrar&rsquo;s Office. Graduate program directors have the discretion and authority to make course substitutions or modifications to ensure the integrity of their programs.</p> <p>The time frame for degree completion includes the time spent in non-matriculated status. For programs requiring fewer than 60 credits, a student must finish the degree within six years of completion of the first Fisher graduate course. For programs requiring 60 or more credits, students must finish the degree within eight years of completion of the first Fisher graduate course. Only the program director and provost or his designee can grant exceptions. Students granted extensions may be required to repeat certain previously taken courses.</p> <h2>Leave of Absence</h2> <p>Students whose progress is interrupted due to an approved leave of absence will continue to follow their original catalog upon their return to the College. If the program has been substantially modified, graduate program directors have the discretion and authority to make course substitutions or modifications to ensure the integrity of their programs and facilitate the transition of these students or to require that the students follow the program requirements in the catalog in force when the students return to the College.</p> </div> </div>
<div id="yui-main"> <div class="yui-b">   <h1>Program Change</h1> <div class="clear"></div> <h2>Change Within a Program</h2> <p>Applicable to current students requesting a change within a program such as:</p> <ul> <li>MBA concentration</li> <li>Literacy program grade level</li> <li>Nursing program</li> </ul> <p>To request a change as indicated above, students must complete the Graduate Academic Change form available in the Registrar&rsquo;s Office. Upon signature from the graduate program director, the form is submitted to the Registrar&rsquo;s Office for approval.

A typewritten statement supporting the student&rsquo;s interest in changing into a new program must accompany the application form. In some cases, new letters of recommendation and other materials may be requested. Students are advised to contact the Office of Graduate Admissions to confirm application items required for submission. Complete applications are forwarded to the Admissions Committee for a decision. If accepted, the student must withdraw from his or her current program and submit an enrollment deposit for the new program. The student will be assigned a new advisor upon deposit. The Registrar&rsquo;s Office will be notified so that the student&rsquo;s record may be updated.

<div id="yui-main"> <div class="yui-b">   <h1>Immunization Requirements</h1> <div class="clear"></div> <p>All entering students are required to provide a completed Health History form with a physical as well as a record of current immunizations. These documents must be presented to the Wellness Center prior to course registration. The New York Public Health Law requires post-secondary students attending colleges and universities to demonstrate proof of immunity against measles, mumps, and rubella. All undergraduate and graduate students taking 6 credits or more must comply. The law applies to persons born on or <em>after</em> January 1, 1957. Nursing, Pharmacy and students in the Mental Health program born <em>before</em> January 1, 1957 must show proof of immunity to rubella. Proof of immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella means the following:</p> <ul> <li>Measles (Rubeola): Two doses of live measles vaccine given on or after the first birthday or physician-documented history of disease or serological evidence of immunity.</li> <li>Rubella (German Measles): One dose of live virus rubella vaccine given on or after the first birthday or serological evidence of immunity.</li> <li>Mumps: One dose of live mumps vaccine given on or after the first birthday or physician-documented history of disease or serological evidence of immunity.</li> </ul> <p>New York State Public Health Law also requires that all college and university students enrolled for at least six credits complete and return the Meningococcal Meningitis Vaccination Response form.</p> <p>Proof of immunization compliance is required prior to course registration.</p> </div> </div>

<div id="yui-main"> <div class="yui-b">   <h1>Payment Policy</h1> <div class="clear"></div> <p>All student accounts must be settled by the date established by the College each semester. An account is considered settled when it reflects a credit or zero balance. This can be achieved by any combination of the following:</p> <ul> <li>Establishing adequate financial aid</li> <li>Setting up a payment plan</li> <li>Paying the balance in full</li> <li>Submitting the Payment/Reimbursement from Employer Plan (PREP) form</li> <li>Arranging for direct billing to your employer</li> </ul> <p>More information about these options can be found online at: <a title="Student Accounts" href="http://www.sjfc.edu/campus-services/accounts">www.sjfc.edu/campus-services/accounts</a>. Students will receive a financial aid deferment of the amount they are borrowing once their loan approvals are received by the Financial Aid Office.</p> <p>Students whose bills are not settled may not be allowed to drop or add classes, move into residence halls, participate in College-sponsored activities, obtain an email account or ID card, use the library, access their meal plan account, access the Athletic Center, or work or park on campus. Additional restrictions may also be imposed.</p> <p>The College reserves the right to transfer past due accounts to an external collection agency when internal efforts have been exhausted. Collection costs and other legal fees incurred will be billed to the student account and become the responsibility of the student.</p> <h2>Penalties</h2> <p>The College reserves the right to deny admission or registration to any person who has not paid in full all outstanding financial obligations to the College. The College may, at its sole discretion:</p> <ul> <li>Refuse to admit or register the student</li> <li>Cancel the student&rsquo;s registration</li> <li>Bar the student from attending class</li> <li>Remove the student from residence housing</li> <li>Withhold the student&rsquo;s transcripts and diploma</li> </ul> <h2>Payment Plan</h2> <p>St. John Fisher College allows students to finance their balance over the course of the semester. Students/families that choose to establish a payment plan must enroll online and set up automatic deductions from a checking account, savings account, MasterCard, Discover Card, or an American Express Card. There is a $40 enrollment fee per semester. A 2.7% convenience fee will be charged to those who choose to pay by credit/debit card.</p> <h2>Payment/Reimbursement from Employer Plan (PREP)</h2> <p>The Payment/Reimbursement from Employer Plan, or PREP, enables students to defer the amount of tuition and fees that their employer indicates it will pay. Students who qualify to use PREP to defer their tuition will not be required to submit payment until the semester has ended and grade reports are available. PREP is only available to students who are in good financial standing with the College and who receive payment of their tuition from their employers.</p> <p>If Student Accounts does not receive payment for the balance in full by the deadline, a late fee of $25 per credit hour will be assessed. St. John Fisher College reserves the right to rescind or refuse this payment option if the College is notified that the student is no longer eligible to receive tuition benefits. Failure to earn a required minimum grade in order to receive payment from an employer and/or withdrawal from a class does not excuse the student from being charged all applicable tuition and fees for that semester.</p> <h3>Direct Billing to Your Employer</h3> <p>Your balance may be deferred if your employer will pay the College in full upon receipt of a bill. To obtain this deferment, submit a letter from your employer stating this, and a bill will be generated directly to your employer for payment.</p> <h3>Forms</h3> <p>Further details and downloadable forms can be found at <a title="Student Accounts website" href="http://www.sjfc.edu/campus-services/accounts">www.sjfc.edu/campus-services/accounts</a>.

Students may apply to the MBA program after successful completion of their first professional year in Pharmacy by completing a Petition for Change of Program form available through the Office of the Registrar. Pharmacy students who have at least 90 credit hours of coursework may take MBA foundation classes prior to applying to the joint program, consistent with current graduate school policy. Pharmacy students may complete up to 18 credit hours of foundation courses prior to applying to the joint program, provided satisfactory grades are achieved and the student remains in good standing.</p> <p>For the Joint Pharm.D./MBA program, up to 18 credit hours can be shared between both degree programs through the MBA concentration (12 credit hours) and Pharmacy electives (6 credit hours) areas. Through this joint program, students will meet the degree requirements for both programs with a maximum of 181 credit hours depending on an applicant&rsquo;s course history. Any course waivers will reduce this maximum number.</p> <p>Up to 6 credits of foundation or core MBA courses can be used as elective credits within the Pharmacy curriculum thus reducing the Pharmacy coursework to 145 credit hours. Additionally, the coursework that a student takes as part of the Pharmacy curriculum will be counted to satisfy the 12 credit hours of concentration coursework required of the MBA curriculum, thus reducing the MBA curriculum to a minimum of 18 (36 maximum) credit hours.</p> <p>Pharmacy students wishing to participate in this opportunity will work with their academic advisor, associate dean for academic affairs in the Wegmans School of Pharmacy, and the director of the MBA program in the School of Business to choose appropriate coursework. Additionally, questions concerning financial aid and/or billing should be directed to the Financial Aid Office and Student Accounts, respectively.</p> <p>Students will be billed standard tuition costs as associated with the Pharmacy program which can include up to 6 credit hours of MBA coursework approved to satisfy Pharmacy electives. Students who take 6 credit hours of MBA foundation coursework in satisfaction of Pharmacy elective coursework, will not be billed separately for those 6 credit hours as the courses are included as part of the Pharmacy program tuition. MBA courses will be billed at the current per credit hour cost of tuition. Students will be billed for these additional courses at the per credit hour graduate tuition rate.</p> <h1>Courses</h1> <p> <a href="/graduate/2015-2016/course-search/detail.dot?id=90b4c35e-5052-4be8-8668-91b243a43d0b"> <b>GMGT-557 Advanced Topics in Fed Tax (3)</b></a><br /> This course addresses advanced topics in individual, corporate, and partnership taxation.

This course investigates current best practices related to: obtaining valid and vital customer insights; the implementation of initiatives that impact customer loyalty; Customer Experience Management; managing customer communities and social media; anticipating and capitalizing on changes in customer value requirements; measuring customer profitability; and aligning the organization around the customer. A team-based term project calls for students to analyze an organization's customer management strategies and uncover important customer insights.

Wilson, Jr. School of Education (SoE) at St. John Fisher College. Our curriculum is grounded in inclusive practice. We believe that teaching all persons requires that the professional educator and executive leader master the knowledge, skills, and dispositions necessary to address the diversity represented by the populations they serve. All children and all adults have a right to enjoy high-quality educational and workplace experiences designed by experts who are deeply and fully committed to the profession of education and the responsibilities of leadership. Our graduate programs in education are designed to deepen, extend, and enhance the professional knowledge of educators, leaders, and executives. Initial certification programs allow graduate candidates whose baccalaureate degrees are in areas other than education to obtain New York State certification in Childhood and Special Education or Adolescence and Special Education. Teaching professionals with initial certification in Childhood and Adolescence may specialize in the critical needs areas of Special Education and Literacy. Graduate candidates with initial certification can qualify for professional certification through our master&rsquo;s degree programs.</p> <p>Teachers who have experience in leadership roles may enroll in the School Building Leader and School Building/School District Leader programs. Educators and executives may challenge themselves at the highest level of study in our Ed.D. in Executive Leadership program where a cohort-based modular structure provides a rigorous yet accessible program of study leading to a terminal degree. The College also offers its approved Ed.D. program in Executive Leadership at extension sites at the College of New Rochelle in New Rochelle, NY, and at Onondaga Community College in Syracuse, NY.</p> <p>Graduate programs in teacher education and educational leadership are registered with the New York State Education Department and are nationally accredited by the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE). The SoE and its related educational programs are located in the Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. School of Education Building and the James S. Alesi Academic Center, state-of-the-art facilities with advanced technological capacity.</p> <h2>Vision</h2> <p>The vision of the School of Education is that our candidates, faculty, and staff have a moral and professional obligation to contribute in meaningful ways to a more just world where people accept the humanitarian mandate to treat one another civilly and honorably and to develop themselves and the students they serve to meet the academic, social, and personal goals necessary for their positive contributions to a peaceful and progressive world. To help realize this vision, our candidates, faculty, and staff will demonstrate an unwavering commitment to: providing all learners with equitable access to knowledge about themselves and the world in which they live; engaging in caring and effective pedagogical practices that support the acquisition of new knowledge and skills; helping all students become independent and lifelong learners, and active participants in a social and political democracy; and advocating for the interests of the students, families and communities that they serve.</p> <h3>Mission Statement</h3> <p>The mission of the School of Education at St. John Fisher College is to provide a quality educational experience that prepares candidates for distinguished careers in their chosen profession and for leadership roles in a diverse, rapidly changing, and increasingly technological society.

This overarching theme captures a central commitment to the philosophy of <strong>social justice</strong>, accomplished through the related tenets of <b>diversity, achievement, compassion, knowledge, and service</b>. The conceptual framework follows a constructivist approach to instruction that shapes who we are and informs our daily pursuit of educational excellence as faculty, staff and candidates in the school. The theme, philosophy and tenets provide a strong context for the work that we do in collaboration with the College community, P-12 schools and broader community; our collective efforts to engage high-quality faculty in programs grounded in inclusive practice, with an extraordinary focus on the teaching profession in service to others, and an informed understanding of the teacher&rsquo;s and educational leader&rsquo;s responsibility to encourage children and adults toward intellectual pursuit and personal growth.</p> <h2>Beliefs</h2> <p>Consistent with our conceptual framework, the School of Education has adopted the following set of shared beliefs to help guide our work:</p> <ul> <li>A strong liberal arts background helps candidates to hone their intellectual skills and understand their chosen discipline more fully.</li> <li>Providing service to others is our civic responsibility.</li> <li>Commitment, dedication, and caring enhance student learning.</li> <li>Moral integrity, collegial, and respectful conduct among the administration, faculty, staff, and candidates are necessary to provide an effective professional and cohesive educational experience.</li> <li>Self-determination, self-advocacy, and self-improvement are keys to lifelong learning.</li> <li>All students can and will learn when provided with the appropriate conditions, opportunities, and resources.</li> <li>Successful learning communities respond to the needs, interests, and backgrounds of each student.</li> <li>Professional educators should develop content knowledge and pedagogical skills concurrently and in the most authentic settings possible.</li> <li>Effective teaching and learning involves the transformation of understanding based on the depth, quality, and flexibility of the content being taught, and its applicability to the prior knowledge of the learner.</li> <li>Maximizing the relationship between technology and other resources enhances educational programs, faculty and staff development, and candidate learning.</li> <li>Understanding and respecting diversity enhances professional and personal development.</li> <li>Reflective practice is the foundation for career-long professional and personal growth.</li> <li>Embracing multiple perspectives expands our knowledge base and informs our decisions.</li> <li>The use of data collection, analysis, and evaluation informs decision-making and guides program improvement.</li> <li>Continuous improvement is essential and most effective when it is informed by research, best practice, and internal and external assessment.</li> <li>Partnerships within our own institution and with other institutions are essential and mutually beneficial.</li> </ul> <h3>Goals</h3> <p>The School of Education has defined six major goals:</p> <ul> <li>Developing and maintaining high quality programming and curriculum</li> <li>Accountability for standards-based practice</li> <li>Employing the many diversities of thought, background and experience that allow teachers and leaders to practice inclusive education in the local and global communities we serve</li> <li>Advancing the technology of teaching and learning; engaging internal and external partnerships to develop</li> <li>Strengthening and evaluating our programs of study in teacher and leader education</li> <li>Providing effective leadership to support the currency, validity and continuous improvement of our programs, practices, services, and resources as vitally important to accomplishing the mission of the college</li> </ul> <h3>Degrees and Policies</h3> <h2>Programs</h2> <h3>Educational Leadership</h3> <p><i>M.S.Ed.: Educational Leadership</i><br /><i>M.S.Ed.: School Building Leader (SBL) and School District Leader (SDL)</i></p> <h3>Executive Leadership</h3> <p><i>Ed.D.

Broikou, <i>Program Director</i></p> <h2>Mission</h2> <p>The mission of the Master of Science in Literacy Education program is to prepare highly capable and ethically responsible literacy professionals who thoroughly understand and can implement the theory and practice of literacy acquisition and instruction. Consistent with the missions of St. John Fisher College and the Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. School of Education, as well as the standards set forth by the International Reading Association and the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, the literacy program develops the knowledge, skills, and dispositions literacy educators need in order to effectively teach all students ways of using multiple forms of text that will provide them with opportunities for success in a global community. The program embraces the belief that all children learn and that learning occurs when students are actively engaged in constructing meaning within a collaborative and supportive community of learners. As such, our candidates in literacy learn how to create learning environments that address the diverse learning needs of students, are informed by best practices, use ongoing meaningful assessment of student learning, and are continuously informed by self-reflection and a commitment to professional development. Finally, our candidates learn how to disseminate information about literacy development to the family and community so that literacy learning becomes meaningful in all aspects of a child&rsquo;s life.</p> <p>The program is designed for teachers who hold initial or provisional classroom certification and wish to become certified in literacy education. We offer graduate literacy programs leading toward professional certification in Literacy Birth to Grade 6 and Literacy Grades 5 to 12. Candidates may elect to complete a program that leads to one certification or both certifications.</p> <h2>Program Goals</h2> <p>This program is designed to develop literacy professionals who:</p> <ul> <li>Demonstrate an understanding of the theory and practice of teaching literacy.</li> <li>Understand literacy acquisition as something that occurs across the lifespan, out of school, as well as in school.</li> <li>Create positive connections with families and communities in order to support both in- and out-of-school literacy learning.</li> <li>Demonstrate an understanding and respect for cultural, linguistic, and ethnic diversity.</li> <li>Have the ability to create programs to address the strengths and needs of individual learners.</li> <li>Have advanced knowledge of the learner and learning environment as well as practical skills in design, implementation, teaching strategies, assessment, and evaluation of literacy programs.</li> <li>Encourage all teachers, regardless of discipline or special areas, to understand language and literacy as tools for thinking and learning that integrate reading, writing, listening, speaking, and visual representation.</li> <li>Have the expertise and habits of mind that lead to equitable pedagogy in order to address the needs of all students, including those with diverse perspectives and special needs.</li> <li>Practice continuous reflection and professional development.</li> </ul> <h2>Admission Requirements</h2> <p>Candidates are required to have initial or provisional teacher certification and present satisfactory evidence of the ability to perform at the graduate level for admission to the graduate program in Literacy Education at St. John Fisher College.

This framework is designed to: provide candidates with an understanding of the major influences affecting American education and expose candidates to the research on motivational theory, leadership effectiveness, and best practices in school/district leadership that enhance learning for all students. The courses in Module I will employ lectures, discussions, assigned readings, case studies, and first-person accounts to provide students with a theoretical context and understanding of the various components of effective leadership.</p> <h3>Module II: Planning and Implementing School Improvement Strategies</h3> <p>This module is designed to increase candidates&rsquo; understanding of the various planning and implementation processes that promote and support school improvement. Specific emphasis will be placed on the study of various models and strategies that have been used to engage and guide the school community in the school improvement process. Candidates will examine case histories of high- and low-performing schools in diverse settings and develop school improvement plans that include the use of technology and information literacy for such schools. The courses offered in this module will focus on strategies that promote high-quality learning environments for all students, including the use of technology and information systems to enrich curriculum and instruction.</p> <h3>Module III: Effective Public Communication</h3> <p>The studies in this module will teach the candidate how to effectively engage the public in the school enterprise at all levels. The courses will focus on parent and community involvement, media relations, creating partnerships, and communicating results. The courses will also discuss strategies for communicating effectively with groups from diverse backgrounds. The goal is to make each candidate an effective communicator.</p> <h3>Module IV: Continuous School Improvement</h3> <p>This module is designed to provide candidates with the knowledge and skills required to apply a systems approach to continuous school improvement. The courses offered in this module will focus on systems that provide: frequent monitoring and assessment of student and staff performance; ongoing staff and student development; opportunities to express and include diverse perspectives, professional development initiatives, programs and practices to celebrate and reward success; and a framework for collaborative internal and external review of school programs, practices, and results. The courses also will include the examination and applications of model technology systems that collect, analyze, and use data to inform decision-making and improve results.</p> <h2>Capstone Project</h2> <p>The capstone project is an integral part of the program. The purpose of the capstone project is to provide candidates with an opportunity to demonstrate the skills, knowledge, and values necessary to provide effective leadership in a variety of complex and diverse school settings. The project should reflect the standards in the candidate&rsquo;s program of study and demonstrate that the candidate has a clear understanding of the School of Education's conceptual framework of social justice and the five interlocking tenets of diversity, compassion, knowledge, service, and achievement. Where possible, the candidate should demonstrate or provide evidence that he or she has acquired facility in the use of technology and information literacy to support instruction and learning. The project requires candidates to complete a portfolio of their best work and make an oral presentation using various technologies on a topic that focuses on the state and national standards for effective school/district leadership, including but not limited to: Effective Leadership Behavior; School/District Assessment; Curriculum and Instruction; Diversity; Improving Student Achievement; Oral and Written Communication; Parent and Community Participation; and Staff Evaluation and Professional Development.</p> <p>A review panel comprised of the Educational Leadership faculty and successful practitioners will evaluate the capstone project. The role of the review panel is to assess the extent to which each candidate demonstrates the essential skills, knowledge, and values of effective leadership based on New York State and national standards. The review categories include: Technical Aspects; Instructional/Programmatic Factors; Interpersonal/Human Relations; Conceptual Issues; Values; and Leadership. Course professors will provide written feedback to each candidate on his or her strengths and areas needing improvement. Successful completion of the project is a program requirement.</p> <h1>Courses</h1> <p> <a href="/graduate/2015-2016/course-search/detail.dot?id=267321"> <b>GEDA-502 Identifying Child Abuse (0)</b></a><br /> This course fulfills the New York State requirement for instructing candidates in the prevention of child abuse (Child Abuse Prevention). <br /><br /> <br /><b>Restrictions:</b> Including: -Major: Bldg andDist Educ Leadership, School Leadership<br /> </p> <p> <a href="/graduate/2015-2016/course-search/detail.dot?id=267321"> <b>GEDA-503 School Violence Prevention (0)</b></a><br /> This course fulfills the New York State requirement for instructing candidates in safety education (Violence Prevention and Intervention); and instructing fire and arson prevention. <br /><br /> <br /><b>Restrictions:</b> Including: -Major: Bldg andDist Educ Leadership, School Leadership<br /> </p> <p> <a href="/graduate/2015-2016/course-search/detail.dot?id=267321"> <b>GEDA-510 Intro to Educational Admin (3)</b></a><br /> This unique course is a part of the Wayne Finger Lakes Leadership Institute and is taught in partnership with the Wayne Finger Lakes BOCES, St. John Fisher College, SUNY Brockport, SUNY Oswego, and the University of Rochester.

Four courses will be offered each semester. Two courses will be offered for the first eight weeks, followed by two courses during the last eight weeks. Courses will be held on Friday evenings and Saturdays every other weekend for an eight-week period (one course Friday evening and another course all day Saturday). A student who chooses the full-time option can complete the program in four semesters. A part-time student who takes two courses per semester can complete the program in four years. It is expected that each student will complete 1,000 hours of clinical practice in accordance with the American Association of Colleges of Nursing&rsquo;s &ldquo;DNP Roadmap Task Force Report&rdquo; (2006). For the post-master&rsquo;s entering student, coursework in the program will provide the student with the additional clinical practice hours, building upon the practice hours that were part of the student&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s degree to meet the 1,000-hour requirement. For the post-baccalaureate entering student, the 1,000 clinical practice hours will be completed within the program. Clinical placements will occur in interdisciplinary settings with an expert/mentor.

The program prepares students for work in community agencies, clinics, hospitals, managed behavioral healthcare organizations, outpatient mental health programs, residential treatment and rehabilitation settings, employee assistance programs, substance abuse treatment programs, colleges, and private practice. The program is designed to emphasize the strengths of individuals and families in order to facilitate recovery and resilience when faced with emotional, mental, or physical challenges. Students will develop a strong understanding of the psychological foundations of mental health and the related developmental issues. Diagnostic assessment, including both its strengths and limitations, is emphasized. The program offers two courses of study: one leads to a Master of Science (M.S.) in Mental Health Counseling; another leads to a Certificate of Advanced Study (CAS) in Mental Health Counseling.</p> <p>In accordance with standards recommended by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) and New York State requirements for licensure as a mental health counselor, the Master of Science (M.S.) curriculum focuses upon counseling areas such as professional identity, social and cultural diversity, human growth and development, helping relationships, career development, group work, assessment, research, program evaluation, and evidence-based intervention skills used in the practice of mental health counseling. Student learning is facilitated through a variety of teaching methodologies, including class discussions, role playing, small-group work, case-study analysis, community integration activities, and classroom simulations. Students also have the opportunity to apply this knowledge in supervised clinical settings. The Certificate of Advanced Study (CAS) curriculum is intended to build on the educational foundation of persons who already possess a master&rsquo;s degree in counseling or a related field and employs similar methods of training to help students meet the full educational requirements for licensure as mental health counselors in New York State.</p> <h2>Admission Requirements</h2> <p>In addition to the materials and credentials outlined in the general admission requirements, the following are also required</p> <h4>For the Master of Science degree program:</h4> <ul> <li>References from references from individuals acquainted with the applicant's abilities.</li> <li>A satisfactory interview with the Admissions Committee of the Mental Health Counseling program.</li> </ul> <p>(The main goal of the interview process is to determine the suitability of the candidate for the field of mental health counseling and for the specific program at St. John Fisher College.)</p> <h4>For the Certificate of Advanced Study program:</h4> <ul> <li>An earned master&rsquo;s degree, or higher, in Counseling or a related field from a regionally accredited college or university with a minimum GPA of 3.00 (evidenced by an official transcript from the master&rsquo;s-granting institution).</li> <li>Completion of master&rsquo;s-level academic course work that includes: human growth and development; social and cultural foundations of counseling; counseling theory and practice; group dynamics; assessment and appraisal of individuals, couples and groups; research and program evaluation; and lifestyle and career development; and clinical instruction in the form of a supervised practicum or fieldwork experience in a counseling setting as part of their graduate program.</li> <li>Work experience in the field of counseling (evidenced by a current resume).</li> <li>References from two individuals acquainted with the applicant&rsquo;s professional and/or academic abilities.</li> <li>A satisfactory interview with the Admissions Committee of the Mental Health Counseling program. (The main goal of the interview process is to determine the suitability of the candidate for advanced study to include a thorough review of the person&rsquo;s prior master&rsquo;s level course work, relevant counseling experiences and professional goals).</li> </ul> <p>For more information regarding application and admission to the Mental Health Counseling program, please contact the Office of Graduate Admissions at <b>(585) 385-8161 </b>or by email at <a href="mailto:grad@sjfc.edu">grad@sjfc.edu</a>.</p> <p>For specific questions regarding the Master of Science or the Certificate of Advanced Study in Mental Health Counseling, please contact Dr. Rachel Jordan at <a href="mailto:rjordan@sjfc.edu">rjordan@sjfc.edu</a> or <b>(585) 899-3858.</b></p> <h3>About the program</h3> <h2>Program Structure</h2> <h3>For the Master of Science degree</h3> <p>Students matriculating in the program leading to a M.S. degree may take courses on a full-time or part-time basis (see recommended sequence of courses). The program begins in the fall semester only. Students are required to complete 60 credit hours: 48 credits of coursework and 12 credits of fieldwork. The 60-credit program includes a supervised practicum experience with a minimum of 100 clock hours (3 credits) and a supervised internship with a minimum of 900 clock hours (9 credits). This application of counseling skills in community sites will allow students the opportunity to grow into effective mental health counselors while being supervised by experienced mental health practitioners.</p> <p>As most placement sites provide services to clients during regular weekday business hours, it is important for students to plan ahead for the time commitment that is required to complete the practicum and internship. It is generally not possible to complete these critical program components in the evening or on weekends. The typical internship requires 20 hours per week at the agency site. Each field experience entails working in approved clinical sites under the direction of qualified site supervisors and faculty instructors. Readiness for placement in a clinical setting is based on a student's satisfactory completion of prerequisite academic courses (minimum GPA of 3.00) and the determination by faculty that the student demonstrates personal qualities that are widely accepted in the counseling profession as the foundation of effective counseling. These qualities include, but are not limited to, flexibility, respectfulness, receptivity to feedback, capacity to listen, appropriate self-disclosure, organization, reliability, commitment to excellence and wellness, and professional integrity. They are measurable and observable in the attitudes and behaviors demonstrated by students in written assignments, classroom discussions, peer group projects, role-plays, and interactions with faculty, staff, and other students.</p> <p>In the semester prior to anticipated placement in a clinical setting, faculty members familiar with the student will evaluate her or his performance on these qualities. Students who meet the criteria will be recommended for placement. Students who demonstrate evidence of deficiencies will have the opportunity to develop and implement a plan, with the aid and support of faculty, to demonstrate improvement. Students who fail to improve will not be allowed to continue in the program but will be encouraged to consult with their faculty advisor regarding alternative educational, training, or employment activities.</p> <h3>For the Certificate of Advanced Study</h3> <p>Students matriculating in the CAS program follow a part-time schedule (see recommended sequence of courses) and begin in the Fall semester only. Because they will have already completed academic and fieldwork courses in counseling at the master&rsquo;s level, the program is designed to build on that foundation by providing instruction in content areas that are specific to the practice of mental health counseling. The basic program entails a total of 18 credit hours: 12 credits of coursework and 6 credits of supervised internship that require a minimum of 600 clock hours providing mental health counseling services in an approved clinical setting under supervision. Students in the CAS attend classes with students in the master&rsquo;s cohort. Similar to the master&rsquo;s-level students, CAS students need to plan ahead to be able to complete their internship requirement at agencies that typically operate during regular weekday business hours. It is generally not possible to complete all hours in the evening or on weekends. The typical internship requires 20 hours per week at the agency site.</p> <p>Because the Certificate program is intended to prepare students to meet the full educational requirements for licensure as a Mental Health Counselor in New York state, a critical part of the evaluation and admission process is a thorough review of all master&rsquo;s-level coursework previously taken for the purpose of determining if the applicant has successfully completed coursework in the content areas described in the Admission Requirements. Applicants who lack the specified requirements, may be admitted with the expectation that they successfully complete (&ldquo;B&rdquo; grade or better) coursework that addresses these requirements in addition to the requirements in the CAS curriculum. In the event that the applicant has completed one or more courses included in the CAS curriculum, including having satisfied part or all the internship requirement, these courses will not need to be repeated unless the applicant earned less than a &ldquo;B&rdquo; grade (academic courses) or &ldquo;Satisfactory&rdquo; grade (internship courses). If the Admissions Committee, working under the direction of the Program Director, cannot determine whether an applicant meets all of the admission requirements as outlined and/or has successfully completed one or more course that is required in the CAS curriculum, the applicant will be advised to submit relevant information to the Office of Professions of the New York State Education Department requesting a formal determination. The resultant determination will be used in establishing a course of studies for the student if he/she meets the other requirements for admission. However, a student will be required to successfully complete a minimum of 15 credit hours in the St. John Fisher College program to be granted the Certificate of Advanced Study. Therefore, if needed, students may select courses from the 60-hour Master of Science in Mental Health Counseling program that are not equivalent to courses already taken in their master&rsquo;s program in order to satisfy the 15 credit hour minimum.</p> <h2>Knowledge and Skills</h2> <p>The content areas of knowledge and skill are based on CACREP standards and New York State requirements for licensure as a mental health counselor. We also value, and demonstrate through our pedagogy, these knowledge and skill areas:</p> <ul> <li>Self-knowledge.</li> <li>Clarity of written and oral communication.</li> <li>A balance of theory and practice.</li> <li>The demonstrated ability to apply knowledge to practice.</li> <li>Both the knowledge and use of empirically supported treatment modalities.</li> </ul> <h2>Personal Qualities and Characteristics</h2> <p>The Mental Health Counseling program further seeks to facilitate the development and enhancement of personal qualities and characteristics in students which create a foundation for the successful practice of counseling:</p> <ul> <li>Flexibility and adaptability.</li> <li>Respectfulness of others including diverse populations.</li> <li>Receptivity to feedback.</li> <li>Capacity to listen and attend.</li> <li>Appropriate self-disclosure.</li> <li>Clarity of communication.</li> <li>Capacity for organization.</li> <li>Reliability and follow-through.</li> <li>Genuineness.</li> <li>Empathy, warmth, and caring.</li> <li>Confidence balanced with humility.</li> <li>Commitment to excellence.</li> <li>Professional integrity.</li> <li>Ability to balance multiple life expectations and commitment to wellness.</li> <li>Sense of humor.</li> </ul> <p>There are numerous specialty areas in the profession of mental health counseling. At the present time, the Mental Health Counseling program at St. John Fisher College has developed a focus on the treatment of adults and children in a variety of community and behavioral health settings. Other elective areas are under consideration.</p> <h2>Professional Standards</h2> <p>The M.S program is accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP). However, CACREP does not accredit non-degree programs such as certificate programs that are designed to for students seeking to satisfy a state&rsquo;s licensing requirements. In providing counselor training opportunities to all of its students the Mental Health Counseling Program adheres to the professional standards and ethical guidelines of the American Counseling Association, the American Mental Health Counseling Association, and the National Board for Certified Counselors. Both the M.S. and CAS are also registered with the New York State Education Department, Office of Higher Education. Rules of the Board of Regents, such as those defining good moral character and unprofessional conduct, are followed. Thus, decisions about admissions and continued enrollment in this program are consistent with CACREP standards, the ethical guidelines of the profession, the laws of New York State, and the policies of St. John Fisher College.</p> <p>Professional standards, state rules, and ethical guidelines acknowledge counselors' responsibility to society and are mechanisms for accountability. Personal or professional conduct that is inconsistent with these standards, rules, and ethical guidelines, as well as with those cited in the Student Code of Conduct, may prohibit an applicant from-being admitted into the Mental Health Counseling program. Students enrolled in the Mental Health Counseling program are expected to exhibit personal and professional conduct that is consistent with these standards, rules, ethical guidelines, and/or policies of St. John Fisher College both in the college setting and while working in practicum and internship sites. Students found to be in violation of these standards, rules, or guidelines will face appropriate action, which may include dismissal from the program and/or College.</p> <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3> <h2>Learning Objectives</h2> <p>Upon graduation, the successful student in the Mental Health Counseling program will be able to:</p> <ul> <li>Demonstrate professional skills and personal qualities required for working as an effective counselor in an interdisciplinary mental health setting.</li> <li>Demonstrate a variety of differential diagnostic assessment skills consistent with the most current diagnostic manual.</li> <li>Demonstrate the ability to use a diverse range of evidence-based intervention strategies.</li> <li>Develop appropriate intervention plans based upon knowledge of culturally relevant variables in client care, including ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic levels, gender, sexual orientation, and disability status.</li> <li>Demonstrate professional behavior consistent with ethical guidelines of Mental Health Counseling professional organizations and regulatory agencies.</li> </ul> <h3>Program Requirements</h3> <h2>Curriculum</h2> <p>It is recommended that students have completed undergraduate courses in Abnormal Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Research Methods, Theories of Personality, Statistics, and Tests and Measurement.</p> <h3>Required Courses</h3> <table class="rounded" style="width: 100%;"> <tbody> <tr> <td class="tl" width="20%">GMHC 500</td> <td>Mental Health Counseling as a Profession</td> <td class="tr" align="right">(3)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GMHC 510</td> <td>Counseling Theories and Strategies</td> <td align="right">(3)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GMHC 515</td> <td>Process of Counseling Clients from Diverse Backgrounds</td> <td align="right">(3)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GMHC 520</td> <td>Assessment in Counseling</td> <td align="right">(3)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GMHC 525</td> <td>Psychopathology and Differential Diagnosis</td> <td align="right">(3)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GMHC 530</td> <td>Treatment Planning and Intervention</td> <td align="right">(3)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GMHC 535</td> <td>Group Theory and Process</td> <td align="right">(2)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GMHC 536</td> <td>Group Activity</td> <td align="right">(1)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GMHC 550</td> <td>Counseling Practicum</td> <td align="right">(3)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GMHC 575</td> <td>Research and Program Evaluation</td> <td align="right">(3)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GMHC 585</td> <td>Biological Foundations of Behavior and Psychopharmacological Interventions</td> <td align="right">(3)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GMHC 590</td> <td>Assessment &amp;

Master&rsquo;s degree prepared nurses also formulate patient care models that promote professional nurse autonomy and clinical decision-making.</p> <p>The graduate nursing programs are based on the values of St. John Fisher College, the Wegmans School of Nursing philosophy, and the American Nurses Association Standards of Practice and Code of Ethics. The curriculum is also guided by educational recommendations from the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), the National Association of Clinical Nurse Specialists (NACNS), the National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties (NONPF), ANA Scope and ANCC certification requirements. The curriculum reflects a commitment to the fundamental nature of nursing, which is professional caring for people by providing compassionate, holistic, evidence-based nursing care to diverse populations.</p> <p>The faculty of the Wegmans School of Nursing is committed to working with the individual needs of the adult learner in planning a program of study that promotes personal balance while successfully completing requirements for the Master of Science in Nursing degree. Nursing faculty values students&rsquo; diversity in perspectives, experiences, and learning styles and anticipates that students will engage in self-directed, interactive learning that is characterized by integrity, initiative, and interpersonal growth. The Master of Science in Nursing programs build on the students&rsquo; undergraduate education in the liberal arts, the sciences, and the discipline of nursing. The curriculum affords students the opportunity to broaden their commitment to nursing excellence through the integration of professional and personal values in their new role development.</p> <p>Graduates of the Master's programs are employed in roles consistent with their area of study and are highly respected for their leadership in health care. Students are well prepared for new, expanded roles through dynamic, interactive classroom experiences, as well as through precepted experiences with highly qualified nurses who are certified and practicing in specialties congruent with coursework.</p> <p>In addition to core course requirements, students in the Nurse Practitioner programs engage in a total of 600 clinical-precepted hours; students in the Clinical Nurse Specialist program engage in a total of 500 clinical-precepted hours of practice. The undergraduate and graduate nursing programs are currently accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), an affiliate of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.</p> <p>Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education<br />One Dupont Circle, NW, Suite 530<br />Washington, D.C. 20036-1120<br />Phone: (202) 887-8476<br />Website: <a href="http://www.aacn.nche.edu">www.aacn.nche.edu</a></p> <h2>Accelerated Opportunity: B.S. to M.S. Option</h2> <p>Current St. John Fisher College nursing students may petition to complete graduate-level coursework during their senior year of undergraduate study. This offers an accelerated approach for qualified traditional baccalaureate students who wish to pursue graduate study at the Wegmans School of Nursing. The accelerated options allow specific graduate-level courses to be taken and for one course to fulfill a designated undergraduate requirement. This shortens graduate degree requirements without compromising didactic and clinical learning experiences in the undergraduate program. Students may take advantage of one or both accelerated options.</p> <p><b>Note:</b> <i>Approval to take graduate courses <b>does not guarantee</b> admission to the M.S. programs. Students who wish to continue their graduate studies at Fisher must complete the application process for graduate admissions. Please contact the <a title="Office of Graduate Admissions" href="http://www.sjfc.edu/admissions/graduate">Office of Graduate Admissions</a> for more information.</i></p> <p>Students beginning their study of nursing at St. John Fisher College follow the curriculum of the Traditional Nursing B.S. program. They may petition to take courses in the graduate program after all 300-level undergraduate courses have been completed with a GPA in Nursing of 3.30 or higher. Students interested in an accelerated option should consult with their advisors and the graduate program director during their junior year at St. John Fisher College for more information and to obtain the appropriate registration paperwork. Approved traditional baccalaureate students may pursue one or both of the following options:</p> <p><strong>First Semester Senior Year (S1)</strong></p> <p><strong>Choose ONE of:</strong></p> <p>GNUR 505 Family Health for APN's<br />GNUR 506 Population Health &amp; Epidemiology (2)<br /> GNUR 507 Health Policy (2)<br />GNUR 508 Healthcare Delivery Systems (2)</p> <h4>&ndash;AND/OR&ndash;</h4> <p><strong>Second Semester Senior Year (S2) </strong></p> <p>GNUR 509 Professional and Systems Leadership (3) <em>&ndash;in place of&ndash;</em><br />NURS 446 Nursing Leadership &amp; Patient-Centered Care III, and lab (3)</p> <h3>Enrollment Status</h3> <p>One of: GNUR 505, 506, 507, or 508 is taken along with other required undergraduate nursing courses during the first semester of the senior year.

Nursing program.</p> <p>GNUR 509 <em>Professional and Systems Leadership</em> (3) is taken during the second semester of the senior year. Students who successfully complete GNUR 509 will not take NURS 446 <em>Nursing Leadership and Patient-Centered Care III and lab</em> (3). The graduate course is posted as undergraduate credit, and there is no additional charge for this course as long as the student is full-time in the undergraduate B.S. Nursing program. The graduate course is added to the student&rsquo;s graduate transcript at the end of the first semester of graduate study at the Wegmans School of Nursing.</p> <h2><a name="rnbs-ms"></a>Accelerated Opportunity: RN to BS to<a name="rnbs-ms"></a> M.S. Option</h2> <p>Current St. John Fisher College RN to BS Online students may petition to complete graduate-level coursework during their undergraduate study. This offers an accelerated approach to R.N. baccalaureate students who wish to pursue graduate study at the Wegmans School of Nursing. The fast track options allow specific graduate-level courses to fulfill designated undergraduate requirements. This shortens graduate degree requirements without compromising didactic and clinical learning experience. Students may take advantage of one or both accelerated options.</p> <p><i><b>Note:</b> Approval to take graduate courses <b>does not guarantee</b> admission to the M.S. programs. Students who wish to pursue their graduate studies at Fisher must complete the application process for graduate admissions. Please contact the Office of <a title="Graduate Admissions" href="http://www.sjfc.edu/admissions/graduate">Graduate Admissions</a> for more information.</i></p> <p>Students follow the curriculum of the RN to BS Online program and substitute two graduate courses for undergraduate nursing courses. Students with a Nursing GPA of 3.30 or higher may petition to take graduate courses after completing four undergraduate RN to BS courses, by submitting the Petition for Graduate Courses form. Students interested in the fast track options should consult with their academic advisors and the graduate program director as early as possible during their studies at St. John Fisher College. Approved students may pursue one or both of the following options:</p> <ul> <li>GNUR 507 Health Policy (2) &ndash; <em><strong>and</strong></em>&ndash; GNUR 508 Healthcare Delivery Systems (2)*<br /><i>in place of</i> NURS 458 Contemporary Professional Issues (4)</li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>&ndash;AND/OR&ndash;</strong></p> <ul> <li>GNUR 543 Advanced Pathophysiology (3)<br /><i>in place of</i> NURS 459 Capstone Professional Portfolio (3)</li> </ul> <p><em>*If only one of these 2-credit courses is successfully completed, the student will be required to take NURS 458 Contemporary Professional Issues, and the graduate course will not be posted as undergraduate credit on the student's academic record. The completed graduate course will be added to the student's graduate transcript at the end of the first semester of graduate study at the Wegmans School of Nursing.</em></p> <h3>Enrollment Status</h3> <p>GNUR 507 Health Policy (2) and GNUR 508 Healthcare Delivery Systems (2) (when both are completed) and GNUR 543 Advanced Pathophysiology (3) are posted as undergraduate credit on the student&rsquo;s academic record, and there is no additional charge for these courses for students in the undergraduate RN to BS Online nursing program. The graduate courses are added to the student&rsquo;s graduate transcript at the end of the first semester of graduate study at the Wegmans School of Nursing.</p> <h2>Progression Policy</h2> <p>Students matriculating in to the Wegmans School of Nursing graduate program must achieve a grade of B (84-86) or higher in GNUR 503, 504, 543, 570, 571, and all clinical courses in order to progress to the next course. If a student does not achieve a grade of B on the first attempt, the student may re-take the course once. If the student does not achieve a grade of B on the next attempt, the student will not be allowed to progress in the program.</p> <h2>Clinical Learning Experiences</h2> <p>The graduate student completes all clinical courses as precepted practicum experiences. The NP programs have a total of 600 clinical hours; the CNS program has a total of 500 clinical hours. Due to the demand for preceptors, the Wegmans School of Nursing cannot permit students to take more than one clinical course/semester. It is the policy of the graduate nursing program that the student&rsquo;s clinical learning experiences are separate and apart from his or her position of employment. Precepted clinical experiences are in a wide variety of health care agencies. Students are required to sign a formal attestation form which communicates their understanding of the clinical placement process.</p> <p>In each clinical course, students must be rated as &ldquo;competent&rdquo; by the clinical preceptor and faculty site visitor in order to successfully complete the course. Failure to be rated &ldquo;competent&rdquo; at the final clinical evaluation will result in a grade of &ldquo;U&rdquo; or &ldquo;F&rdquo; for the course. Clinical failure can be due to unsatisfactory professional behavior or lack of clinical competence. Earning a grade of &ldquo;U&rdquo; or &ldquo;F&rdquo; in <strong>more than one graduate course</strong> will result in dismissal of the student from the graduate program. The grade of &ldquo;U&rdquo; is equivalent to a course failure.</p> <p><b>Note:</b> <i>At least 50 percent of the clinical hours for Primary Care program students must be in primary care settings.</i></p> <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3> <h2>Program Outcomes</h2> <p>Upon completion of the Master of Science in Nursing programs, the graduate is prepared to:</p> <ul> <li>Synthesize knowledge from nursing and related disciplines to design, implement, and evaluate health services, educational offerings, program resources, and research.

The School is committed to providing an environment that promotes academic excellence, service, and scholarship; encourages each student&rsquo;s intellectual and personal development; and fosters the development of lifelong learners committed to advancing the profession of pharmacy.</p> <p>In July 2010, the Wegmans School of Pharmacy was granted full accreditation from the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE).</p> <h1>Academic Programs</h1> <h2 class="page-break">Doctor of Pharmacy</h2> <h3>Overview</h3> <p></p> <p>The Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree is awarded after successful completion of four years of professional study. Two years (62 semester credits) of pre-professional education is required for admission, followed by four years of professional studies. The curriculum is designed such that courses integrate information, building upon one another, and encompass both didactic and experiential learning. An integrated course model will be used to provide the foundations of drug actions. In this model, physiology, medicinal chemistry, and pharmacology are integrated to allow the student to see a broad view of how the physiochemical properties of medications interact with human physiology. The courses will be taught by system (i.e., cardiovascular, neurological, renal, etc.). Medications and human physiology pertinent to each system will be team-taught by faculty in their respective areas. Starting in the second year, an integrated course will be used to provide the foundations of the application of drug therapy to disease. Also taught by system (i.e., cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases, etc.), the pathophysiology and application of drug therapy will be team-taught by faculty in their respective areas. Running throughout the first three years of the curriculum will be professional courses intended to provide the student with an opportunity to integrate and apply information and to work in small groups to complete projects and assignments, develop critical thinking skills, and foster collaboration. These courses will also provide early laboratory work in compounding and an opportunity for further development of both verbal and written skills. The curriculum also provides students with a broad range of introductory and advanced pharmacy practice experiences over the last three years of the professional curriculum. These experiences are student-centered, activity-based, outcome-oriented and they are designed to develop attitudes, values, and skills that foster the effective delivery of pharmaceutical care.</p> <h3>About the program</h3> <h2>Admission Requirements</h2> <p>Admission to the Doctor of Pharmacy program requires the equivalent of two years (62 semester hours) of pre-professional education at an accredited college or university.

The goal of the cooperative program is to educate students to assume responsibilities of management, executive and administrative positions within the pharmaceutical industry as well as health care delivery systems that provide pharmaceutical information, services, and products to patients.</p> <h3>Accreditation and Registration</h3> <p>The Wegmans School of Pharmacy&rsquo;s Doctor of Pharmacy program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education and the School of Business MBA program is accredited by AACSB International&mdash;The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. Both programs are individually registered with NYSED, and now jointly registered as well.</p> <h3>About the program</h3> <h3>Degree Requirements</h3> <p>As standalone programs, the Pharmacy degree requires completion of 151 credit hours and the&nbsp;MBA degree requires completion of 30-48 credit hours, depending on previous coursework. Up to 18 credit hours of MBA foundation coursework can be waived through equivalent coursework previously completed at the undergraduate level, reducing the&nbsp;MBA program to the minimum 30 credit hours. Taken separately both programs would require 181-199 credit hours for degree completion depending on previous coursework.</p> <p>For the Joint Pharm.D./MBA program up to 18 credit hours can be shared between both degree programs through the&nbsp;MBA concentration (12 credit hours) and Pharmacy electives (6 credit hours) areas. Through this joint program, students will meet the degree requirements for both programs with a maximum of 181 credit hours depending on an applicant&rsquo;s course history. Any course waivers will reduce this maximum number.</p> <p>Up to 6 credits of foundation or core MBA courses can be used as elective credits within the Pharmacy curriculum thus reducing the Pharmacy coursework to 145 credit hours. Additionally, the coursework that a student takes as part of the Pharmacy curriculum will be counted to satisfy the 12 credit hours of concentration coursework required of the MBA curriculum, thus reducing the MBA curriculum to a minimum of 18 (36 maximum) credit hours.</p> <h3>Admissions Requirements</h3> <p>Traditional&nbsp;MBA students have a baccalaureate degree; however, Pharmacy students may or may not have a prior degree, even though all Pharmacy students have at least 64 semester hours of undergraduate credits. Candidates for this joint program must first meet the entrance and admissions requirements for the Doctor of Pharmacy program. Students may apply to the joint program after successful completion of their first professional year in Pharmacy by completing a Petition for Change of Program through the Office of the Registrar. Pharmacy students who have at least 90 credit hours of coursework may take&nbsp;MBA foundation classes prior to applying to the joint program, consistent with current graduate school policy. Pharmacy students may complete up to 18 credit hours of foundation courses prior to applying to the joint program, provided satisfactory grades are achieved and the student remains in good standing.</p> <h3><b>Advisement</b></h3> <p>Pharmacy students wishing to participate in this opportunity will work with their academic advisor, associate dean for Academic Affairs in the Wegmans School of Pharmacy, and the director of the&nbsp;MBA program in the School of Business to choose appropriate coursework. Additionally, questions concerning financial aid and/or billing should be directed to the Financial Aid Office and Student Accounts, respectively.</p> <h3>Scheduling</h3> <p>The&nbsp;MBA program has three semesters during the calendar year consistent with the College master academic schedule, which include the fall, spring, and summer. Typically, during the fall and spring semesters, any given&nbsp;MBA course will meet one weeknight from 6:00 &ndash; 9:05 p.m. During the summer semester courses most commonly meet in a 6-week condensed schedule format, meeting two weeknights from 6:00-10:00 p.m. A sample curriculum for the joint program integrating all coursework including all foundation courses can be found in the section that follows.</p> <h3>Cost of Program</h3> <p>Students will be billed standard tuition costs as associated with the Pharmacy program which can include up to 6 credit hours of MBA foundation coursework approved to satisfy Pharmacy electives. Students who take 6 credit hours of&nbsp;MBA foundation coursework in satisfaction of Pharmacy elective coursework, will not be billed separately for those 6 credit hours as the courses are included as part of the Pharmacy program tuition. MBA courses will be billed at the current per credit hour cost of tuition. Students will be billed for these additional courses at the per credit hour graduate tuition rate. It is recommended that students consult with Financial Aid if they have borrowing needs.</p> <h3>Degree Award</h3> <p>Once all degree requirements are met for an individual program, a student may petition for graduation from that particular program. For example, should a student complete all Doctor of Pharmacy degree requirements first, the student can petition for graduation from that program. Any&nbsp;MBA foundation coursework accepted in satisfaction of the 6 required elective credit hours for Pharmacy will appear on the Pharmacy transcript. Once the remaining degree requirements are met, the student will need to petition for graduation from that program. If the latter completed program is MBA, the student will need to petition for graduation from that program once all MBA degree requirements are met. Any coursework accumulated as part of the MBA, including up to the 6 credit hours counted toward the Doctor of Pharmacy, will be available on a separate&nbsp;MBA transcript.</p> <h3>Program Requirements</h3> <table style="width: 100%;" class="rounded"> <tbody> <tr> <td class="odd tl" width="25%">Course</td> <td class="odd">Title</td> <td class="odd tr" align="right" width="15%">Credits</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PHAR 3117</td> <td>Top 200 Drugs I</td> <td align="right">(1)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PHAR 3122</td> <td>Pharmacy Calculations</td> <td align="right">(2)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PHAR 3135</td> <td>Healthcare Delivery</td> <td align="right">(3)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PHAR 3142</td> <td>Principles of Pharmaceutical Science</td> <td align="right">(4)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PHAR 3144</td> <td>Systems Pharmacology I</td> <td align="right">(4)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PHAR 3148</td> <td>Biosystems I</td> <td align="right">(4)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PHAR 3217</td> <td>Top 200 Drugs II</td> <td align="right">(1)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PHAR 3218</td> <td>Introduction to Diversity</td> <td align="right">(1)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PHAR 3226</td> <td>State Pharmacy Law</td> <td style="text-align: right;">(2)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PHAR 3227</td> <td>Drug Information</td> <td align="right">(2)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PHAR 3240</td> <td>Biosystems II</td> <td align="right">(4)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PHAR 3242</td> <td>Pharmaceutics</td> <td align="right">(4)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PHAR 3244</td> <td>Systems Pharmacology II</td> <td align="right">(4)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PHAR 4112</td> <td>Applied Pharmaceutics I</td> <td align="right">(1)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PHAR 4135</td> <td>Communications and Counseling Skills</td> <td align="right">(3)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PHAR 4139</td> <td>Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience I</td> <td align="right">(3)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PHAR 4144</td> <td>Systems Pharmacology III</td> <td align="right">(4)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PHAR 4157</td> <td>Applied Pathophysiology and Therapeutics I</td> <td align="right">(5)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PHAR 4212</td> <td>Applied Pharmaceutics II</td> <td align="right">(1)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PHAR 4236</td> <td>Population-Based Healthcare</td> <td align="right">(3)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PHAR 4238</td> <td>Self-Care &amp;
